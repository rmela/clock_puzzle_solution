# Coins on Clock Puzzle

Solutions to coins on clock [interview question](https://github.com/atsepkov/puzzles/blob/master/interviews/easy/coins-on-clock/README.md)

Given four dimes, four nickels, and four pennies, fill a clock face with the coins by placing coins on the clock, moving forward each time
by N hours, where N is the denomination of the coin.

From the problem statement:

    Here’s a quick walkthrough using the first solution, PPDDNNPDDPNN, to illustrate how the game is played. First move is a Penny
    and it can be played anywhere so let’s put it at 6. Next move is a penny which moves us up an hour so I put that penny on 7. Next
    is a dime which moves us up ten hours which goes past twelve o’clock and back around to 5, so I place the dime on the 5. Another
    dime moves us to 3. And continuing with a nickel at 8, nickel at 1, penny at 2, dime at 12, dime at 10, penny at 11,
    nickel at 4 and nickel at 9. And the sequence wins because all hours of the clock are now covered with a coin. Thanks to John Balboni
